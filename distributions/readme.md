# Probability Distributions

The exercises in these folders provide an introduction to R
and the Python data stack through a review of probability
distributions.  The idea is that one chooses either
**Python** or **R**.  Attempting to *closely* follow both
usually results in confusion since they have similar but
different syntax for the same concepts.  However, following
one path with an occasional glimpse of the other is *mostly
harmless*.

The PDF document in the `tex` folder is a mathematical
companion to both tracks.  It provides a theoretical review
and motivation for the distributions presented in the
R and Python labs.  The PDF is generated by a math
typesetting program called **Latex**.  It's the standard
publishing software used in the mathematics community.
