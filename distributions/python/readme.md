# SciPy Statistics

This directory holds the workshop for the **Python** track
on probability distributions.  The file `distributions.ipynb`
contains the *Jupyter Notebook* contents of the workshop.
As a raw file it is simply JSON.  It is meant to be viewed
through a Jupyter Notebook viewer.  There are two ways to
effect this.

## 1. Install Jupyter

If you have Python installed through `conda` on your system,
then installation of Jupyter is simply

```
conda install jupyter
```

This is the preferred method because it allows you to interact
with the notebook.  You simply change to the directory
containing the notebook file and run

```
jupyter notebook
```

This will start a Jupyter server and a browser window connected
to the server from which you can select the notebook.

## 2. View on GitHub

If you don't have Jupyter installed, you can still view the
notebook through a notebook plugin viewer on GitHub.  You
will not be able to interact with the notebook.  But you
can see all the commands and enter them in a separate Python
session.
