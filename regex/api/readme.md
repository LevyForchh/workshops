# Regular Expression APIs

Regular expressions are supported in many programming languages.
Each of these subfolders provide a language-specific presentation
of their respective API.  Emphasis is placed on the API syntax
rather than advanced regular expression syntax.  The assumption
is that the reader is proficient with regular expressions and
the programming language, just not with regular expression
*in the programming language*.  It is also
intended to serve as a refresher for who simply haven't used
the API in a while.

Some programming models, such as R and Python, have advanced interaction
features, such as R Markdown and [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks.
In many cases GitHub can render these natively.  In other cases, a
"PDF equivalent" is provided.  Of course, the optimal learning experience
is obtained by downloading these files and interacting with them on your
own workstation.
