# Python Regular Expressions

This section on Python regular expressions is expressed as a
Jupyter Notebook.  GitHub will render `PyRegex.ipynb` well as a static
page.  But for best results, you should install Jupyter Notebook
on your own workstation with an IPython kernel and run the notebook
interactively (experimenting with the expressions).
