    "## 2. Regular Expression Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Python compiled regular expressions may be applied to strings\n",
    "through several methods.  These methods may be invoked in one\n",
    "of two ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. As a method of the compiled regular expression object, or\n",
    "2. As a static method defined on `re`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first case requires two steps.  The first step, invoking\n",
    "the `compile` method was shown in the previous section.\n",
    "Then apply the regular expression to a string in a separate\n",
    "statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "By splitting compilation and application, it's\n",
    "especially suitable for applying a regular expression in a loop\n",
    "since the compilation is done once outside the loop and applied\n",
    "within the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second method is more convenient for the programmer.  The\n",
    "regular expression and the string on which to apply it are\n",
    "specified in the same method call.  This performs the compilation\n",
    "and evaluation in one step.  This is easier to code and read\n",
    "most of the time.  We'll demonstrate both types below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of these methods return a\n",
    "**Match** object.  There are several ways to interogate a\n",
    "`Match` object.  The most basic way is treat it like a boolean.\n",
    "In this case, **Match always returns `True`**.  In other words,\n",
    "if one of the methods returned a `Match` object at all, something\n",
    "was matched.  If nothing was matched, the method will return\n",
    "`None` (which evaluates to `False` as a boolean).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Search\n",
    "\n",
    "The `search` method searches for the presence of a match anywhere\n",
