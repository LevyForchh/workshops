# Regular Expressions

A *regular expression* specifies search criteria on a body of text.
Often the "body of text" is a text file divided into lines.
The expression is applied to each line and a
match is determined on a per-line basis.  Regular expressions are
also used in programs where the search criteria is applied to a
single string.  In data science applications, we apply regular
expressions to vectors of strings.

## Basic Operators

The most fundamental regular expression is just a plain string.
