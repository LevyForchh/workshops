Chapter 17 

The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy notes that 
**Disaster Area**, a plutonium rock band from the
Gagrakacka Mind Zones, are generally held to be not 
only the loudest rock band in the Galaxy, but in
fact the loudest noise of any kind at all. Regular
concert-goers judge that the best sound balance is
usually to be heard from within large concrete
bunkers some thirty-seven miles from the stage,
whilst the musicians themselves play their 
instruments by remote control from within a heavily 
insulated spaceship which stays in orbit around the 
planet - or more frequently around a completely
different planet.

Their songs are on the whole very simple and mostly
follow the familiar theme of boy-being meets girl-being
beneath a silvery moon, which then explodes for no
adequately explored reason.

Many worlds have now banned their act altogether,
sometimes for artistic reasons, but most commonly
because the band's public address system contravenes
local strategic arms limitation treaties.

This has not, however, stopped their earnings from
pushing back the boundaries of pure hypermathematics,
and their chief research accountant has recently been
appointed Professor of Neomathematics at the University
of Maximegalon, in recognition of both his General and
Special Theories of Disaster Area Tax Returns, in which
he proves that the whole fabric of the space-time
continuum is not merely curved, it is in fact totally bent.
