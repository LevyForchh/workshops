# R Workshops

These workshops are conducted to cutivate R programming and statistical
analysis skills within Los Angeles County technical staff.

Starting with Workshop 3, the workshop notes were generated with
[Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) with
an R language kernel.  Because of the math content, Pandoc and Latex were
used to generate the PDF files.  The first two workshop are exceptions.

* __Workshop 1__ is PDF export of a PowerPoint summary.
* __Workshop 2__ is a PDF scan of hand-written notes.

The rest of the main notes were generated with Jupyter Notebook.
Math supplements were generated with [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/).
