# R Workshops

## Firewall Note

GitHub provides a renderer for `*.ipynb` files.  But the renderer
is loaded from

<https://render.githubusercontent.com/>

If you click on a notebook link and it fails to load,
try to load the link above first so that your browser
authenticates through the firewall.  Then (using your back button)
come back to this page and select the desired notebook link.

## Overview

These workshops are conducted to cutivate R programming and statistical
analysis skills within Los Angeles County technical staff.

Starting with Workshop 3, the workshop notes were generated with
[Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) with
an R language kernel.  Because of the math content, Pandoc and Latex were
used to generate the PDF files.  The first two workshop are exceptions.

* __Workshop 1__ is PDF export of a PowerPoint summary.
* __Workshop 2__ is a PDF scan of hand-written notes.

The rest of the main notes were generated with Jupyter Notebook.
Math supplements were generated with [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/).
