# R Workshops

These workshops are conducted to cutivate R programming and statistical
analysis skills within Los Angeles County technical staff.

The notebooks and PDF files were generated using Jupyter notebooks with
an R language kernel.  Because of the math content, Pandoc and Latex were
used to generate the PDF files.  (Workshop2 came from hand-written notes.)
