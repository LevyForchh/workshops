# Python Workshops

## Firewall Note

GitHub provides a renderer for `*.ipynb` files.  But the renderer
is loaded from

<https://render.githubusercontent.com/>

If you click on a notebook link and it fails to load,
try to load the link above first so that your browser
authenticates through the firewall.  Then (using your back button)
come back to this page and select the desired notebook link.

## Overview

I only started making the Python workshops available publicly with
Workshop 5 because earlier ones incorporate sensitive datasets in
a few of the examples.
