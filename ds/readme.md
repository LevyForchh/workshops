# Fall Schedule

We took a break though the second part of the Summer.
We covered the basic language syntax on each track
(R and Python) and practiced exploratory analysis
techniques using respective packages that each environment
provides. Below is an outline of how I plan to proceed in the Fall.


## Python Track

* __Plotting__ – Review `matplotlib`; but then switch to `Seaborn`.
* __Analysis__ – Explore time series features of `pandas` in-depth.
* __Programming__
  - We briefly discussed modules and barely touched on classes.  
    We'll address these code organization topics in more detail
    as well as packages and editing environments that make sense
    for larger programs.
  - Cover iterators and generators.
  - External Environment – We worked with files in the past.
    In the Fall we'll explore network and database APIs.
* __Time__ – The previous sessions have been an hour and a half,
  which is a long time to demand anyone's attention for new material.
  However, 90 minutes was intended to accommodate practicing the new
  material; not just learning it.  Many of the participants were new
  to Python and not acclimated to the Python environment; the drilling
  fostered a degree of comfort with Python.  Now that we have that
  comfort level, I think we can scale the sessions back to 60 minutes.
* __Logistics__ – Skype
* __Reference__ – I'll be loosely following Python for Data Analysis,
  2nd Edition, by Wes McKinney.


## R Track

* __Plotting__ – Switch from the Base plotting package to `ggplot`.
* __Analysis__ – Begin working with the *tidyverse* suite of R utilities.
* __Statistics__ – We covered basic random variable concepts, distributions,
  and introduced functions of random variables.  In the Fall, we'll explore
  special random variable functions that represent sampling.  This will give
  us a practical footing for estimation methods and confidence intervals.
  The goal is to have a grip on statistical inference.  That's useful in its
  own right and needed to understand any modeling topics we might hope to explore
  next Spring.
* __Programming__ – Aside from the tidyverse and ggplot topics mentioned above,
  we'll dig into more advanced R topics such as scopes, closures, method dispatch,
  and the S3 object model.
* __Time__ – We still need 90 minutes.  In some ways, we're "starting over" with
  the tidyverse tools and ggplot.  Between that and the multitude of statistics
  topics, we've got a lot to cover.
* __Logistics__ – We'll continue meeting in the Cerritos training room until all
  the participants have a working R platform on their workstation.  Then we'll
  switch to Skype.
* __Reference__ – We'll be following R for Data Analysis by Hadley Wickham for the
  plotting and analysis topics.  I'll be winging the rest of the topics as usual.
  The author has made R for Data Analysis freely available: http://r4ds.had.co.nz/.


## Common Themes

* __Presentation Skills__ – From time to time I hope to lean on guest presenters
  for certain topics.
* __Jupyter Notebooks__ – will continue to be used for disseminating workshop notes
  for both Python and R.
* __GitHub__ – Participants should have a GitHub ID and begin playing with it.
  Most workshop notes will be published on the ISAB GitHub site
  (https://github.com/lacounty-isab/workshops).  I encourage participants to fork
  this repository (it's public), enhance or add to the notes, and issue a pull
  request to improve these workshops.


## What's Missing

* __Modeling__  – I hope to introduce responsible modeling in the Spring.  I expect
  to follow Introduction to Statistical Learning
  (http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/index.html).  
  It's an excellent book; but it does presuppose some inference topics that we'll
  develop in the Fall.  The authors make the PDF available for free.  In fact,
  Stanford offers a free class that follows the book.  We might just follow that
  (https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/about).
* __Big Data__ – We need to understand small data first.
